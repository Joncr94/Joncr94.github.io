# Data Analyst

## Introduction
As an aspiring data professional, I drive to collect information for high level decision making. In my previous line of work as a Subject Matter Expert, I frequently utilized data storage, collection, and query techniques to collaborate with researchers and drive forth company initiatives. 

Recently, I completed the IBM Data Analytics certificate and discovered my passion for analytics. Through the program, I learned skills for Python, Python libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, web scraping, APIs, data cleaning, databases, and numerous data analyzation techniques. Using these new found skills, I started working on my own projects to collect and gather insights for my own curiosities. Please feel free to review some of my projects below!
