# Data Analyst

## Introduction
As an aspiring data professional, I drive to collect information for high level decision making. In my previous line of work as a Subject Matter Expert, I frequently utilized data storage, collection, and query techniques to collaborate with researchers and inform company initiatives. 

Recently, I completed the IBM Data Analytics certificate and discovered my passion for analytics. Through the program, I learned skills for Python, Python libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, web scraping, APIs, data cleaning, databases, and numerous data analyzation techniques. Using these new found skills, I started working on my own projects to collect and gather insights for my own curiosities. Please feel free to review some of my projects below! 

## Data Analytics projects 
- [Analyzing Web Scraped Zillow Listings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RSJoMNw07y0vF2pKU-Z3Adfjz8TsupZ8SSLQthDUDcE/edit#slide=id.p)
  For this project, I web scraped over 1,000 Zillow listings utilizing Python and Jupypter Notebooks in Visual Stuido code. Scraped data was cleaned and transformed using Pandas to CSV and uploaded to Tableau for analysis. Data was then summarized and contextualized in Google Slides.
- [Software Development Market Trends](https://coursera-assessments.s3.amazonaws.com/assessments/1717451844287/ec3bcdad-cfd5-42d5-8dcc-4a583f3a37ed/Final-capstone-story-template.pdf)
  For this project, I used Stack Overflow's yearly developer survey to evaluate popular programming tools and tools developers were planning to use in the next year. Charts were made using IBM Cognos Analytics and slides were created in PowerPoint.
